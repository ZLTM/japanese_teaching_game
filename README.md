Edutainment game made as a tesis for the undergrad title of systems engineer.
Learn basic kanji by solving puzles and translating the correct readings.

Both the translation system and the dialogue systems where made from scratch,
the dialogue system allows the writter to input the character name, the position in the screen, the events called during the dialogue,
the sprite to be used, and the sentences.
